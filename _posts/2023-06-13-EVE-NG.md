# EVE-NG Network Emulation

These are some notes and things from working with EVE-NG. I use the community version of EVE-NG in my home lab, to help study things that I don't work on every day but need to know incase I need to troubleshoot

## Setting up a FortiGate in EVE-NG

When setting up a FortiGate VM in Eve-NG, for lab work, I had issues getting to the GUI until I did the following

```shell
config system route
    edit 1
        set device "port1"
        set gateway 192.168.1.1 # Or whatever IP you want
    next
end
config system interface
    edit "port1"
        set ip 192.168.1.99 255.255.255.0 # Or whatever Gateway you want
        set allowaccess ping https ssh http
        set type physical
    next
end
```

Please note, that on some (older) version of FortiOS, you replace ```config system route``` with ```config router static```
