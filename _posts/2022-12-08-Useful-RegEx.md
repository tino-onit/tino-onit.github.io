# RegEx Snippets

These are some useful RegEx snippets that I find myself using over and over. This is a list that will be updated often

---

## Selecting all the trailing whitespace (tabs or space)

```shell
[ \t]+$
```

## Select everything between two words

```shell
(.*)
```

## Remove all blank lines

```shell
^(?:[\t ]*(?:\r?\n|\r))+
```

> Example: Lets remove the blank lines from this config

```shell
config firewall address
edit "*.evercast-webrtc.com"

set type fqdn
set fqdn "*.evercast-webrtc.com"
next
```

> Open Search and Replace and type in the RegEx above and the results will be

```shell
config firewall address
edit "*.evercast-webrtc.com"
set type fqdn
set fqdn "*.evercast-webrtc.com"
next
```

## Select everything up until specified character

```shell
^[^$]*
```

## Select everything, from a character/word/other, to the end. Including blank spaces

```shell
([ ,]+)(connected)(.*)
```

> Example: Lets remove everything except the interface name

```shell
# Cisco switchport
Gi1/0/30                        connected    107        a-full a-1000 10/100/1000BaseTX
```

> Open Search and Replace and type in the RegEx above and the results will be

```shell
Gi1/0/30
```

## Select all characters up to a specific character

If you need to select everything up until a specific character, you can use the following

> Example: 160117.070: CMD: 'show stackwise-virtual links' 16:44:44 PDT Mon Sep 11 2023


```shell
160([^:]*):
```

Will select _160117.070:_ up until the first ":"
